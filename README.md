# portfolio-project-about-me

## Description

Here I just want to complete code challenge from Codecademy, but it's also nice to meet my employers with this project.

## What I use?

In this project I use HTML5, CSS and vanilla JS to build a little webpage about me.

## How to run my code

You don't really need to download that project or smth like that, later I'll just add a link to that project here.
