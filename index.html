        <h4>My hobbies, life, studying achievements and career</h4>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Andrew aka personal_it_jesus and as you can suspect I'm
          passionate about music, especially bands like Depeche Mode, AC/DC,
          Rammstein, Druha Rika and many others. I'm from Rivne, Ukraine. My
          native language is Ukrainian, but also I can speak Russian and Polish
          as vell, and my Engish is something about upperintermediate level.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many other hobbies that I like, but I almost sure you are
          visiting that page to see my project, expirience, skills and so on.
          Maybe I'll dissappoint you now, but I don't have a lot of work
          expirience in that branch like an emploee. Yes, I have learned a lot
          of stuff, also now I have last year in my college in Poland and then
          I'll had an techical degree (System administrator and Web Programmer).
          Before the college I finished school in Ukraine with average 11.2 on
          12 points measure system. In past I was passionate about Maths,
          Physics and Chemistry so now I don't have problems with coding,
          because I can easely build logical chains/constructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been 'self-employed' in Ukraine for 4 years, that means that I
          just had solving issues with computers and other electronic things,
          e.g. "Windows/Printer/Phone repairing", cleaning laptops and PC,
          network management etc. At some point in my life I decided that I
          don't really want to repair something with my hands and it's easier to
          code to earn money so I started coding.
